# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This project showcases my work and skills as a web developer, with a particular focus on my journey through computer science and web development. The website is hosted using GitHub Pages, and it includes two versions:

- **Version 1:** A simple portfolio built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, located in the `root` directory.
- **Version 2:** A modern portfolio built with **React** and found in the `/build` directory.
